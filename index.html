  <p>Going into the 12th Season of the Apex games for the survival of the fittest in teams of three. A random player from your squad will be elected to become what is known as 'Jumpmaster'. From there either you can wait for the call of the 'Jumpmaster' to drop down from an airship to an area of the map or drop solo to begin the game. Once you've reached a part of the map, you and your teammates are to search and loot for items of weaponry, health, body armor, etc. to objectively win the Battle Royale or battles until your squad is eliminated. </p>

  <p>This genre of gameplay is First Person Shooter, FPS, for the most part unless you are flying until you land from the dropship or jump tower. </p> 
  <p>Casting the 'Emote' button during gameplay will allow the player to go into third person to see your character act out it's defaulted taunting body movement.</p>
  <p>Through personal opinion this game is definitely one of the best that I have ever played. The efficiency of the game is continuous to no lag or barely showing lag. There will be bugs of course like all programs but that is something that us as developers have to live with until they are 'squished' away.</p>

  <p>The main gameplay known to present day that most fans appreciate is Battle Royale, BR, in teams(20 total) of three until the last team stands while sets of 'closing rings' collapse to ensure battle is not avoided.</p>
  <p>From season to season the gameplay modes have evolved from just being on a solo quest to 'Duos', compromised of 30 teams of two.</p>
  <p>As of season 9 (Legacy), an extra mode was accepted to stay for the long haul and that is 'Arenas'. A mode that is round by round best out of three by default unless the opposing team that is falling behind in winning makes a comeback to tie. From there either team must win by two rounds to win the match.</p>
  <p>You can imagine that as the calendar year passes that the Respawn team would release new or familiar gameplay dependent on the holiday that the calendar month falls on.</p>

    <header>Battle Season</header>
  <p>To present day there are 12 Battle Seasons. Each having their own theme of a new playable character and if lucky a new limited time of gameplay, e.g. is season 12 'Control'. 'Control' being a 9v9 until one of the two teams reach 1500 points by obtaining three different areas(A, B, C areas) of a map.</p>
  <p>Each season is set to last approximately 90 days. Each tailored to a theme of gameplay or releasing of a new character.</p>
  <p>Though this may be a FPS genre of a game, there is a story behind each character. These are done thru the comics released from the main page of the game free and slightly animated but mostly dialouged.</p>

    <p>Each legend character has a passive, tactical, and ultimate ability that can alter the fate of their squad through each battle.</p>
    <p>The passive ability for a character is as important as it's ultimate. Compared to the tactical and ultimate, there is no timeframe needed for usage.</p>
    <p>Tactical abilities are more probable to use in combat. Some chracters can have stock of their respectable ability while others must wait an average of ten plus seconds.</p>
    <p>Ultimate abilities aren't just a one-time use per match. Their timeframe is set at a more extendable time but there is a way to speed up that process with an item that is apprehendable amongst looting the battle map area. That item is called an, 'Accelerant'.</p>
